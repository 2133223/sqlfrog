If used with a match_parameter of \u0027m\u0027, it matches the end of a line anywhere within expression. * Matches zero or more occurrences. + Matches one or more occurrences. ? Matches zero or one occurrence. . Matches any character except NULL. | Used like an \"OR\" to specify more than one alternative. [ ] Used to specify a matching list where you are trying to match any one of the characters in the list. [^ ] Used to specify a nonmatching list where you are trying to match any character except for the ones in the list. ( ) Used to group expressions as a subexpression. {m} Matches m times. {m,} Matches at least m times. {m,n} Matches at least m times, but no more than n times. \\n n is a number between 1 and 9. Matches the nth subexpression found within ( ) before encountering \\n. [..] Matches one collation element that can be more than one character. [::] Matches character classes. [\u003d\u003d] Matches equivalence classes. \\d Matches a digit character. \\D Matches a nondigit character. \\w Matches a word character. \\W Matches a nonword character. \\s Matches a whitespace character. \\S matches a non-whitespace character. \\A Matches the beginning of a string or matches at the end of a string before a newline character. \\Z Matches at the end of a string. *? Matches the preceding pattern zero or more occurrences. +? Matches the preceding pattern one or more occurrences. ?? Matches the preceding pattern zero or one occurrence. {n}? Matches the preceding pattern n times. {n,}? Matches the preceding pattern at least n times. {n,m}? Matches the preceding pattern at least n times, but not more than m times."
