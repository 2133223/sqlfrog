Specifically, DATEDIFF determines the number of datepart boundaries that are crossed between two expressions. For example, if you are calculating the difference in years between two dates, 12-31-2008 and 01-01-2009, the function returns 1 year despite the fact that these dates are only one day apart. If you are finding the difference in hours between two time stamps, 01-01-2009 8:30:00 and 01-01-2009 10:00:00, the result is 2 hours."
