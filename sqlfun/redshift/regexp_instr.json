The default is to use case-sensitive matching. i – Perform case-insensitive matching. e – Extract a substring using a subexpression. If pattern includes a subexpression, REGEXP_INSTR matches a substring using the first subexpression in pattern. REGEXP_INSTR considers only the first subexpression; additional subexpressions are ignored. If the pattern doesn\u0027t have a subexpression, REGEXP_INSTR ignores the \u0027e\u0027 parameter."
